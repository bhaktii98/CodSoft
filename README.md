This repository contains three tasks: 
Task 1: Portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Task 2: Landing page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Task 3: Simple calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The zip file contains videos showcasing all three tasks: Task 1 (Portfolio), Task 2 (Landing Page), and Task 3 (Simple Calculator). Additionally, through this internship, I have gained essential skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with practical experience in web development project implementation.
